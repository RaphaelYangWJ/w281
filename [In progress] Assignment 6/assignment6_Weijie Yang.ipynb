    " ### Overview\n",
    "Lighting estimation is critical for many computer vision applications, and demonstrates a common use of least squares operations on pixel values. Accurate estimation of the lighting environment under which an image was captured can be used for image forensics, image re-lighting, 3D surface modeling, and compositing images with rendered objects, and many other techniques. For this assignment we will compute the lighting direction for a simple toy problem consisting of a sphere with faceted edges.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the illuminated sphere shown above. If, as in this case, the light illuminating the sphere is distant and the sphere is a Lambertian surface, the amount of light $I$ that strikes any point ($X,Y,Z$) on the sphere's surface is equal to the dot product between the 3-D surface normal $N$ at ($X,Y,Z$) and the single 3-D vector $L$ which specifies the direction to the light source. In this assignment, you will estimate the direction to the light $L$ using least squares. You can assume that there is only one light source in the scene and there is no ambient light.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Description\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Write a Python code to load the given 3-D [$X$-](X.npy), [$Y$-](Y.npy), and [$Z$-](Z.npy) coordinates of the sphere and the corresponding illumination [$I$](I.npy). After loading the files you will have four 41 x 41 matrices corresponding to the illumination $I$ and the $X$-, $Y$-, and $Z$- coordinates of the sphere. That is, for any $u$ and $v$ between 1 and 41, the illumination on the sphere's surface at ($X_{u,v},Y_{u,v},Z_{u,v}$) is $I_{u,v}$. Display this sphere using the `plot_surface` method in Python. Set the color values so that the displayed sphere looks like the above image without the $L$ and $N$ arrows.  \n",
    "&nbsp;\n",
    "\n",
    "2. For each ($X,Y,Z$) on the sphere's surface, determine the surface normal $N$. The surface normal at any point on the sphere is a vector from the sphere origin to the point. Since the sphere is centered at the origin, this is a simple calculation. The surface normal should be specified as a unit vector.  \n",
    "&nbsp;  \n",
    "\n",
    "3. Using least-squares, estimate the lighting (a 3-D vector). Your solution should create an over constrained system of linear equations in the surface normal and illumination at each point ($X,Y,Z$) on the sphere's surface that is not in shadow (i.e. intensity is greater than zero). Your solution for the light vector $L$ is determined by solving this system of linear equations using least-squares.   \n",
    "&nbsp;\n",
    "\n",
    "**Do not use pseudo inverse functions like `numpy.linalg.pinv` or least squares functions `numpy.linalg.lstsq`.**\n",
